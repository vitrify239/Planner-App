Planner App for Windows - Beginner-Friendly Setup Guide
=======================================================

This guide is written for users who are not very technical.
Follow it slowly, step by step.

What this app does
------------------
- Shows your tasks for a week (today + next 6 days)
- Lets you create subtasks under a main task
- Lets you switch to month view and choose a day
- Saves your tasks on your own computer


PART 1 - Install Python (one-time)
----------------------------------
1) Open your web browser and go to:
   https://www.python.org/downloads/

2) Click "Download Python 3.x.x".

3) Run the installer.

4) IMPORTANT: check the box that says:
   "Add Python to PATH"

5) Click "Install Now".

6) After installation, click "Close".


PART 2 - Open the project folder
--------------------------------
1) Make sure this Planner App project folder is on your PC.

2) Open File Explorer and go to the project folder.

3) In the folder, click the address bar, type:
   powershell
   and press Enter.

A PowerShell window should open in this folder.


PART 3 - Create app environment and install app requirements
------------------------------------------------------------
Copy and paste each command below into PowerShell, one at a time.
Press Enter after each one.

1) Check Python:
   python --version

2) Create a virtual environment:
   python -m venv .venv

3) Activate the virtual environment:
   .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

If you get an execution policy error, run this first:
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
Then run activation again:
   .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

4) Install required packages:
   pip install -r requirements.txt


PART 4 - Start the app
----------------------
In the same PowerShell window:

   python -m planner_app

The Planner app window should open.


PART 5 - Basic use
------------------
Week tab:
- This is the default screen.
- It shows 7 days: today plus next 6 days.
- Click "Add Task" to create a new task.
- Click a task, then "Add Subtask" to add a child task.
- Use "Edit" to change text/date.
- Use "Delete" to remove task.
- Use the checkbox to mark complete.

Month tab:
- Click a date in the calendar.
- Tasks for that date appear on the right.
- Add/edit/delete works the same way.


PART 6 - Where your tasks are saved
-----------------------------------
Your tasks are stored in a local database file at:

   C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\.planner_app\planner.sqlite3

Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your Windows username.


PART 7 - Build an executable (.exe)
-----------------------------------
You can package the app so it runs like a normal Windows program.

Important:
- Build on a Windows machine.
- Keep the same PowerShell window with your virtual environment active.

Step-by-step:
1) Install packaging tool:
   pip install pyinstaller

2) Build executable:
   pyinstaller --name PlannerApp --windowed --noconfirm planner_app\__main__.py

3) When build is done, open this folder:
   dist\PlannerApp\

4) Run this file:
   PlannerApp.exe


PART 8 - Sharing with another Windows user
------------------------------------------
If you send the built app to someone else:
- Send the whole "dist\PlannerApp" folder, not just one file.
- They should run PlannerApp.exe from that folder.
- Windows SmartScreen may show a warning for unsigned apps.
  They can click "More info" then "Run anyway" if they trust the source.


PART 9 - Common problems and fixes
----------------------------------
Problem: "python is not recognized"
Fix:
- Python may not be installed or PATH was not set.
- Reinstall Python and ensure "Add Python to PATH" is checked.

Problem: "No module named PySide6"
Fix:
- Activate venv and run:
  pip install -r requirements.txt

Problem: App opens but no tasks are listed
Fix:
- Normal for first run. Add tasks manually.

Problem: Can I move my saved tasks to another PC?
Fix:
- Yes. Copy this file:
  C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\.planner_app\planner.sqlite3
- Put it in the same location on the new PC.


You're done.
If you can run `python -m planner_app`, your setup is correct.
